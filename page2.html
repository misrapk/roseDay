          On this Rose Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration <br />for you.
          As the petals of roses whisper the language of love, my heart speaks volumes for you, my beloved. Though miles may separate us on this Rose Day, our love knows no bounds, transcending the distance with each beat.
            
            ALFU, in this moment, envision me holding your hand, gazing deeply into your eyes, and professing my undying love for you. Feel the warmth of my embrace, the tenderness of my kisses, and the intensity of my yearning as if I were right there beside you.
            My love for you knows no distance, ALFU, for you are the rose that blooms eternally in the garden of my heart.
